        "We initially set out to use the IPUMS data set to compare and contrast public and private school students with a host of factors including post-grad salary, owned real-estate, veteran status, and other factors to find interesting correlations and trends to analyze the difference in attending individuals and long-term effects of the two schooling systems. While we are still using the IPUMS data set, we are pivoting toward a more comprehensive analysis of the similarities and differences between public and private school characteristics to determine the fundamental differences of both types of institutions. This will involve a comparative analysis between a public and private school dataset both from school year 2019-2020 and an analysis of IPUMS census data regarding the characteristics of students and graduees who attended each type of school.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second data set that we are using comes from NCES and involves private schools, the day-to-day attributes of those private schools, and also attributes of the students within the schools. This dataset will allow us to view how successful private school students are overall and if they attend a 4-year university after. \n",
        "\n",
        "The third dataset that we are using also comes from NCES and is information on public schools and their day-to-day information such as student-to-teacher ratio and how many students per grade there are. This will allow us to compare and contrast the different situations of students at these schools.\n",
        "\n",
        "The fourth dataset we are using is the Nations Report Card datset. It contains standardized test scores for reading and writing for both public and private schools. This allows us to visualize the differences between the students testing abilities after being in their respective schooling system for some time as we chose grade 12 for the standardized testing scores. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our collaboration plan is to utilize Google Drives Collab Feature to simultaneously work on a Python notebook. We will make regular commits to a github repository for version control and fork/work on independent copies of the file at times when we are both working on different aspects of the file. Our group has been meeting one to two times per week in order to recap what we have been working on and set goals for each of us to individually commit and push to the project by our next meeting. The majority of our meetings will take place in person on Wednesday night each week as we are both available then. \n",
        "\n",
        "Through the four data sets, the question we hope to answer is \"What are the fundamental difference in characteristics between public and private schools and what is the general difference in the outcomes of students attending either? Given the data, what differences in experience are likely to occur (Part 1) and what outcomes should we expect to see (Part 2)?\"\n",

The most prevalent of these factors to keep in mind is the wealth of the average private school family vs. that of the average public school family. Almost every private school has a pricy tuition and families who have the resources to pay most likely also have the resources to help their children succeed in school and onwards. Therefore, while we cannot say for certain how much of an influence private school had on their outcomes, we can measure the correlation between going to one type of school and having a certain performance and outcome."

        "It is difficult to say whether private schools have a better overall effect on children than public schools, as this can vary depending on many factors, including the specific schools and the individual needs and abilities of the children involved. In general, private schools may have smaller class sizes and more individualized attention, which can be beneficial for some students. However, public schools are often more diverse and may provide a broader range of extracurricular activities and other opportunities for students. Ultimately, the best choice for a child's education will depend on their individual needs and the specific schools available in their area. Something that has been observed through our data analysis is that overall, the standrdized test scores of private schools are slightly higher than public schools for every year and subject that we measured. For higher test scores, private school may be the better option, but it is still hard to tell whether or not those who attended public vs. private school have a better degree of success in life. \n",
