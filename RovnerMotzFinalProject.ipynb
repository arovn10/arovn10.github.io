        "We initially set out to use the IPUMS data set to compare and contrast public and private school students with a host of factors including post-grad salary, owned real-estate, veteran status, and other factors to find interesting correlations and trends to analyze the difference in attending individuals and long-term effects of the two schooling systems. While we are still using the IPUMS data set, we are pivoting toward a more comprehensive analysis of the similarities and differences between public and private school characteristics to determine the fundamental differences of both types of institutions. This will involve a comparative analysis between a public and private school dataset both from school year 2019-2020 and an analysis of IPUMS census data regarding the characteristics of students and graduees who attended each type of school.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second data set that we are using comes from NCES and involves private schools, the day-to-day attributes of those private schools, and also attributes of the students within the schools. This dataset will allow us to view how successful private school students are overall and if they attend a 4-year university after. \n",
        "\n",
        "The third dataset that we are using also comes from NCES and is information on public schools and their day-to-day information such as student-to-teacher ratio and how many students per grade there are. This will allow us to compare and contrast the different situations of students at these schools. \n",
        "\n",
        "Our collaboration plan is to utilize Google Drives Collab Feature to simultaneously work on a Python notebook. We will make regular commits to a github repository for version control and fork/work on independent copies of the file at times when we are both working on different aspects of the file. Our group has been meeting one to two times per week in order to recap what we have been working on and set goals for each of us to individually commit and push to the project by our next meeting. The majority of our meetings will take place in person on Wednesday night each week as we are both available then. \n",
        "\n",
        "Through the three data sets, the technical question we hope to answer is \"What are the fundamental difference in characteristics between public and private schools and what is the general difference in the outcomes of students attending either?\" The practical question we are trying to answer is “Is private school worth the exccedingly high cost?” "
